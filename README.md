# todotxtclient

A multi platform graphical Todo.txt client keyboard oriented but (hopefully) cute

## Goals 

The goals of this project is firstly to have fun, because I am looking for a new job and I am bored ! 

It should be compatible with the official Todo.txt application for Android 

## Yet another todo.txt graphical client

Todo.txt has a lot of clients, but none that are : 
	- mutli platform web and Linux and mac and Windows
	- keyboard oriented (vim inspired), a good productivity application should never need the mouse

## Why javascript? I mean typescript but you know it's the same in the end

Has I start this project, I have little to no knowledge of the Javascript, and to be honest I am not even sure that I like it :D. But I think this is the best language for this project! And I always try to find the best tool for the job. 

This is the best tools for the job for many reason, objective and subjective ones (this is a personal project, having fun is a prerequisite) 

- This project is mainly a UI project and it is great for UI
- These days you can deploy it on anything from the desktop the browser as a site or an extension 
- I don't know it but: 
	- I should because it's everywhere and I will need it
	- I love working with thing I don't know because there is no presure to be good at it. If I fail it normal, but if I don't it awesome. 
	- I cannot troll it as well as if I've use it
  - **No IDE Needed.** I can code in vim and I've never done it before, but it will be fun

## Thanks 

Thanks to [@bmedy](https://github.com/bmedy) for his help and support, because he do know javascript. It is not because I am autonomous in my work that I am a loner.
